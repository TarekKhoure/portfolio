    <p>
      <b>I'm Tarek Khoury</b>, and my journey in the world of web development
      began in <b>2017 </b>during my
      <b> First year at Birzeit University in Ramallah, Palestine.</b> The
      pivotal point arrived during my <b>4th year</b> when I gained practical
      experience through training at <b>Exalt Technologies. </b>
      Remarkably, after just a month of training, I transitioned into the role
      of a junior developer at the company, all while having one more year left
      in university.
